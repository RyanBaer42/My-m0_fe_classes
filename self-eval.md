# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

At first it felt good since my partners and I were able to learn basic comprehension of classes on our own. Once I got to the problems in the repository, new aspects like creating a default property that can still be dynamic began to stump me. I find it frustrating at times trying to interpret websites like stack overflow and developer.mozilla.org. It takes a lot of focus to even discern what the website is trying to communicate. Although these challenges were headaches I felt a strange amount of satisfaction working my way through them and seeing the end results.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

I feel like I did a better job of giving myself longer breaks. Before I would only walk away for a max or 10 minutes but today I would feel comfortable walking away for an extended period of time, resetting, then coming back and getting to work. Focus isn't hard at the moment since I have limited distractions but I definitely need to acknowledge when I'm at my mental stopping point.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

I need to lock down the things I'm aware of needing to improve. I need to tell myself its ok to walk away for a longer amount of time and recognize when the time to do that is. Like Kaitlyn told us on the first day, turing is a marathon and not a sprint and the most important thing for me is to make sure I don't burn myself out.
